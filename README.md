# Tutorial Scripts

This repository contains small coding projects and practice scripts created while reviewing its documentation. They are not meant to be taken as production level rather just small scripts. 
- These are personal learning projects and may not follow production best practices.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment (probably critique a lot) with the code.
