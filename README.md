# Tutorial Scripts

This repository contains small Python projects and practice scripts created while reviewing the Python documentation. They are not meant to be taken as production level rather just small scripts. 
- These are personal learning projects and may not follow production best practices.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment (probably critique a lot) with the code.
